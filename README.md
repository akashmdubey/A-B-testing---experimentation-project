#A/B testing: A step-by-step guide in Python
This is a walkthrough of how to design and analyse an A/B test using Python. 


# Business Case 
Letâ€™s imagine you work on the product team at a medium-sized online e-commerce business. The UX designer worked really hard on a new version of the product page, with the hope that it will lead to a higher conversion rate. The product manager (PM) told you that the current conversion rate is about 13% on average throughout the year, and that the team would be happy with an increase of 2%, meaning that the new design will be considered a success if it raises the conversion rate to 15%.

# Objective
Before rolling out the change, the team would be more comfortable testing it on a small number of users to see how it performs, so you suggest running an A/B test on a subset of your user base users.


# Steps 

1. Designing our experiment
2. Collecting and preparing the data
3. Visualising the results
4. Testing the hypothesis
5. Drawing conclusions
